Q. What is civic technology, and how can Smart Cities benefit from it?

A. Civic technology refers to tools that support solving urban problems and help governments strengthen their connection with the public. For example, OneBusAway, a mobile application that provides real-time public transit information, is a representative civic tech project. This app is built on open data, maintained by volunteers, and serves a clear public purpose by helping citizens navigate the city.

Civic tech pursues social equity. In many ways, technology has made it more difficult for people to access information and services. For older adults with limited digital literacy or low-income groups who cannot easily afford digital devices, technology can become a barrier rather than a bridge. Nevertheless, civic tech evolves with the public purpose of ensuring that all citizens can equally benefit from information and services.

Ideal civic tech contributes to the development of smart cities. A smart city is an urban model that uses data and ICT to improve efficiency, sustainability, and quality of life. Civic tech contributes to smart cities by enhancing transparency and citizen participation, simplifying access to public services, and promoting equity. It supports data-driven decision-making by analyzing urban issues with open data and providing evidence for policy improvements. It also simplifies administrative procedures and service delivery to improve citizen convenience. Moreover, it works to strengthen equity by enabling participation for digitally marginalized groups. Finally, it fosters democratic governance by allowing citizens to take part directly in problem-solving processes.

In the end, civic tech is not simply a tool for making cities more efficient. it is a key for creating cities that are more equitable and democratic.
